#### Intention
This repository will be used as reminders and for quick implementations of some of the new browser javascript apis in order to improve user experience.

#### Structure
Every api is in its own script inside `apis_js` directory for ease of use. To see it in action, check for the api's implementation in its own small web page inside `apis` directory or navigate from [repository demo page](https://gunesyu.github.io/browser-api-snippets).
:warning: Don't forget to look at developer console.
